From the Firestorm website:

[FIRESTORM IS BUILDING A BETTER SOLUTION](https://www.launchfirestorm.com/#home-mission)

The current way unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are built is slow and expensive. At Firestorm, we are developing mission-adaptable aerial vehicles and slashing total cost of ownership (TCO).

- 1/5 of the cost of traditional methods

- Built in hours not weeks â€“ 10X faster than the status quo

- Distributed manufacturing: build anytime, anywhere
