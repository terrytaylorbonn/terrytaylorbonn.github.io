ZiptieAI is my (Terry Taylor) AI intelligent drone project. There are 4 main URLs:

- **[Wiki](https://github.com/terrytaylorbonn/auxdrone/wiki)**. The first place to look for udpated project info. .
- **[Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HrzLExPTAL5PIKx_j_y0GJ6_RANR8Tjm)**.  A lot of large .docx files that contain detailed instructions (details are everything for this project). I am working alone without (human) assistance (AI like google search, StackOverflow, and Youtube make working alone possible), so accurate, useful documentation is a critical part of this project for me. 
- **[ziptieai.com](https://ziptieai.com)**. The future main website (only this page for now; Jekyll on Github pages). A future conceptual overview of the entire "assembly line" of the project.
- **[docs.ziptieai.com](https://docs.ziptieai.com)**. For now just a skeleton docs website (ReadTheDocs/Sphinx). 


#### **Why "ZiptieAI"?**

The original idea comes from the zipties the Ukrainian army was using for their very flexible and mission ready 
![drones](/assets/ziptiedrone2.png). But it also stands for how you have to approach learning this stuff if you don't have someone to lead you by the hand. If run down the wrong rabbit hole (get lost) or you hit the wall (a tech problem you can't solve), then you need a backup path to getting things done. To quickly "ziptie" the working pieces together, and worry about the details later. 

#### **The keys to success**

I started with no experience with AI / drones in late 2023, and I have been working alone. I've made a lot of progress. The keys to success are:
- Find things that you can get running (what I wrote above in "Why ZiptieAI?"). Anything. Demos, Youtube tutorials. 
- Find answers to bugs with Youtube, stack overflow, Google search. 
- Document as much as possible (for me thats mainly the **[Google drive docs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HrzLExPTAL5PIKx_j_y0GJ6_RANR8Tjm)**.
- Constanly update the plan and the concepts (for that I used the **[Wiki](https://github.com/terrytaylorbonn/auxdrone/wiki)**).
