ZiptieAI is my (Terry Taylor) AI intelligent drone project. There are 4 main URLs:

- **[Wiki](https://github.com/terrytaylorbonn/auxdrone/wiki)**. The first place to look for udpated project info.
- **[Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HrzLExPTAL5PIKx_j_y0GJ6_RANR8Tjm)**.  A lot of large .docx files that contain detailed instructions (details are everything for this project). I am working alone without (human) assistance (AI like google search, StackOverflow, and Youtube make working alone possible), so accurate, useful documentation is a critical part of this project. 
- **[ziptieai.com](https://ziptieai.com)**. The future main website (only this page for now). Built with Jekyll on Github pages. In the future, I will add a conceptual overview of the entire "assembly line" of the project.
- **[docs.ziptieai.com](https://docs.ziptieai.com)**. For now just a skeleton docs website (ReadTheDocs/Sphinx). 
  
#### **Why the name "ZiptieAI"?**

The original idea for the name came from the zipties the Ukrainian army uses for their very flexible and mission ready drones. But it also stands for how you have to approach learning this stuff if you don't have someone to lead you by the hand. If you run down the wrong rabbit hole (get lost) or hit the wall (a tech problem you can't solve), then you need a backup path to get things done. You need to "ziptie" the working pieces together to finish the mission. 

#### **What is different about ZiptieAI?**

ZiptieAI is morphing (slowly) into a well-designed concept. The documentation will be very useful (helping you to move forward, not left and right, down many levels of rabbit holes with endless links to "see also", "for more info", "make sure you have", etc). 

#### **The keys to success**

I started this project in late 2023 with no previous experience with AI / drones. I have been working alone and, amazingly, I've made a lot of progress. The strategy I have used is:
- Find anything that you can get working. Search everywhere (Youtube, Google, etc).  
- Find bug help with Youtube, stack overflow, and Google search. 
- Document as much as possible (for me thats mainly the **[Google drive docs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HrzLExPTAL5PIKx_j_y0GJ6_RANR8Tjm)**).
- Constanly update the plan and the concepts (for me thats the **[Wiki](https://github.com/terrytaylorbonn/auxdrone/wiki)**).

#### **Before you get into this business...**

Nvidia's $80 billion boss Jensen Huang recently said that if you want to be a success you need to face 'pain and suffering'. I found that statement to be very inspiring. Rather than pretending to be smarter than everyone else, he told us what we need to do to "succeed". 

I picked this project because its a great way to improve my skills in Python, Linux, microcontrollers, and C/C++ (and when I started, I was in Ukraine, where the ziptie drone revolution was just taking off). I was not sure I could make it work. Some of the steps are really complex. My recommendation is that if you decide to get into the AI drone business without assistance, never give up and always have a backup plan you can ziptie into your project :).
