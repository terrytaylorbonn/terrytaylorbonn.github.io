ZiptieAI is my (Terry Taylor) AI intelligent drone project. There are 4 URLs:

- **[Wiki](https://github.com/terrytaylorbonn/auxdrone/wiki)**. The wiki is updated usually every day. The overview of the project and [documentation](https://github.com/terrytaylorbonn/auxdrone/wiki/Documentation).
- **[Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HrzLExPTAL5PIKx_j_y0GJ6_RANR8Tjm)**.  A lot of large .docx files that contain detailed instructions (details are everything for this project). I am working alone without (human) assistance (AI like google search, StackOverflow, and Youtube make working alone possible), so accurate, useful documentation is a critical part of this project for me. 
- **[ziptieai.com](https://ziptieai.com)**. The future main website (only this page for now; Jekyll on Github pages). A future conceptual overview of the entire "assembly line" of the project.
- **[docs.ziptieai.com](https://docs.ziptieai.com)**. For now just a skeleton docs website (ReadTheDocs/Sphinx).
