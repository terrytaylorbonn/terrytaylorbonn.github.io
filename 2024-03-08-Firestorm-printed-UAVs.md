A [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2024/03/08/firestorm-labs-3d-print-drones-ukraine-pentagon) (paywall) appeared on my phone about a company that wants to 3D prints UAVs near the front lines. 



From the Firestorm website:

[FIRESTORM IS BUILDING A BETTER SOLUTION](https://www.launchfirestorm.com/#home-mission)

The current way unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are built is slow and expensive. At Firestorm, we are developing mission-adaptable aerial vehicles and slashing total cost of ownership (TCO).

- 1/5 of the cost of traditional methods

- Built in hours not weeks â€“ 10X faster than the status quo

- Distributed manufacturing: build anytime, anywhere
