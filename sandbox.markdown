Work on the API sandbox ([video overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9C912Omm7U)) started in Sep 2024, focusing on API/API-doc tech demos. I changed the name to "AI API sandbox" on 25.0203.

# Deployments (the main goal)

The main goal of this site are demos for 
- [Stack deployments](https://github.com/terrytaylorbonn/auxdrone/wiki/Stack-deployments) (1-3) that contain
  - Stack-based API docs (Swagger, GraphQL) (1)
- [Doc (website) deployments](https://github.com/terrytaylorbonn/auxdrone/wiki/Main-doc-deployments) that contain
  - Web-based docs (web sites) (4.1-4.2)
  - AI-generated content and AI chat (4.3-4.5)

# Lab notes

The final 6 sections are basically my lab notes (*I hope to feed some version of these into an AI RAG to either generate docs or for chat*).

- [2 Stacks/frameworks](https://github.com/terrytaylorbonn/auxdrone/wiki/2-Stacks-and-frameworks). The APIs/API-docs were created for the backend. Now need to be integrated into a complete stack. This part focuses on 
  - Base tech (HTML/JS/CSS).
  - Front ends (React, Vue, Angular, etc), what the end-user uses to access the backend.
  - Full stack (MERN).
  - Any other backend / server-side frameworks (Javascript, Python).
- [1 APIs/API-docs](https://github.com/terrytaylorbonn/auxdrone/wiki/1-APIs-and-API-docs) 
  - Creating APIs (REST, GraphQL) and API-docs on the local PC.
  - Tests with API tools (Swagger, Postman, etc).  
- [3 Deployment](https://github.com/terrytaylorbonn/auxdrone/wiki/3-Deployment). Deployment on remote hosts including
  - Dedicated hosting platforms (Netlify, Vercel, Render, etc).
  - AWS/GCP/Azure (also using Terraform).
  - CI/CD.
- [4 Doc/chat sites (WIP)](https://github.com/terrytaylorbonn/auxdrone/wiki/4-Doc-sites) (Non-MERN, non-code) 
- [5 API management](https://github.com/terrytaylorbonn/auxdrone/wiki/5-API-management) (AWS, Gravitee.io, Kong, Kubernetes Gateway, Apigee, Mulesoft, IBM).
- [6 Other](https://github.com/terrytaylorbonn/auxdrone/wiki/6-Other) (Git, other AWS, etc).
